# **Advanced Actor Transform - How to setup:**
- Download AdvancedActorTransform from the [Unreal Marketplace](https://unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/26fa6336e06b41d2baad1f9308d9019b) and add it to your project
- Feel free to delete the ExampleContent folder in case you don't need it, but it's really recommended to have a look at the example levels to understand how the plugin works.
- [**Recommended for cinematic**] Add AdvancedActorTransformComponent to any actor you want to use as controller, you can drag it from `/AdvancedActorTransform/Blueprints/Components/AdvancedActorTransformComponent` to your actor, or you can add it from the Add Component button in the Details panel:

- [**Recommended to use in game**] Add AdvancedActorTransformComponent to your character from the Add Component button in the Blueprint Editor:

    ![AddComponentFromBlueprint](https://github.com/Ares9323/UEPluginsDocumentation/blob/master/AdvancedActorTransform/Images/AddComponentFromBlueprint.png)

- Read the documentation below to understand how the plugin works and how to get the most out of it.
- All the material instances in the example level inherit from the `M_MatrixTransformMaster` material, it's not mandatory to use this material but it clearly explains how to connect the `MF_AAT_Control` function into your materials:

- Change the default values of the AAT Component according to your needs.

# How the plugin works:
Since version 2.0, this plugin has been completely rewritten to be more efficient and no longer alters the transform of the actors in tick, but simulates the movement using the world position offset inside the material. This allows you to use the plugin in game mode without any performance impact because the operation is handled by the GPU.
This obviously has some limitations, the shader only changes where the pixels are rendered, the collision remains where it was originally. If you need to use the collision for some reason, you can combine the older version with the new one, using the old one only for the meshes that need collision and the new one for the rest.

# How to use the plugin:
This plugin mainly relies on three material functions:
- `MF_AAT_Translate`
- `MF_AAT_Rotate`
- `MF_AAT_Scale`

They all have two Vector3 parameters and perform matrix operations with them, the first parameter is the original position of the pixel, the second parameter is the offset that will be applied to the pixel.

### MF_AdvancedActorTransform

They are grouped inside the library function `MF_AdvancedActorTransform`, that applies them in the correct order and allows you to choose through the exposed switch param "Use Actor Position" if you want to use the actor position or the object position to transform the pixel location from absolute to local space.
This function is the core of the plugin, it has four Vector3 inputs and two Vector3 outputs, the inputs are: `TranslationVector`, `RotationVector`, `ScaleVector` and `InNormal`, the outputs are: `WorldPositionOffset` and `RotatedNormal` (Because rotation is the only transformation that affects the normal. If no normal is provided as input, VertexNormalWS will be used as fallback).

You can provide raw inputs to this function to control the actor transform, you can look inside `MF_AAT_Control` to see how I implemented it, this function is volountarily large and made to be as flexible as possible, but you can create your own functions removing the features you don't need and making it more efficient.

### MF_AAT_Control:

The function `MF_AAT_Control`, used in the example levels, contains several parameters that you can use to control the behaviour of the material.
There's a recurring term in the parameters called "Alpha", it's used to control the interpolation between the original transform and the target transform.
There are several built-in ways to control the alpha, but you can implement the logic you need inside the material.
- **Use Distance from component** - This is not a parameter but it's the default behaviour, the alpha is calculated based on the distance between the pixel and a MPC Vector4 value set by the AdvancedActorTransform component. By default, this enables two parameters called `MinDistance` and `MaxDistance`, you can use them to control the interpolation between the original transform and the target transform. `MinDistance` is the distance at which the alpha is 0, `MaxDistance` is the distance at which the alpha is 1, and the alpha is interpolated between the two values based on the distance of the pixel from the component.
- **Use Camera Position** - This boolean parameter is like the previous one, but instead of the distance from the component, it uses the distance from the camera. Obviously, this has some limitations but it doesn't require any component setup, if there are many cameras in the world, they will see a different result looking at the same object, this could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your needs.
- **Animate Alpha** - This boolean parameter has been introduced for debug purposes, it allows you to animate the alpha from 0 to 1, it's useful to see the interpolation between the original transform and the target transform. This parameter introduces the parameter `TimeMultiplier`, that allows you to control the speed of the animation. In addition to the debug purpose, this parameter can be used to animate an object without using the tick event, for example if you need a floating object that moves up and down or rotates back and forth, you can use this parameter to animate the alpha and the object will move without almost any performance impact (The collision will not be updated though).
- **Use Custom Alpha** - You can set the value manually in a dynamic material instance, by through the parameter "Alpha".
___
The category of settings called `AAT Settings|Invert` contains four boolean parameters, respectively:
- **Invert Alpha** - Inverts the alpha value, if it's 0 it will be 1, if it's 1 it will be 0. This applies to all the transformations.
- **Invert Translation** - Inverts the translation alpha value only.
- **Invert Rotation** - Inverts the rotation alpha value only.
- **Invert Scale** - Inverts the scale alpha value only.

You can easily see the effect of these parameters in the example levels.
___
In the category called `AAT Settings|Parameters` you can find three Vector4 Parameters (Alpha channel is not used), used to control the translation, rotation and scale of the object. RGB channels are used to control the X, Y and Z axis respectively. They are:
- **TranslationVector** - The translation offset that will be applied to the object.
- **RotationVector** - The rotation offset that will be applied to the object.
- **ScaleVector** - The scale offset that will be applied to the object.

___
In the category called `AAT Settings|MPC` you can find four boolean parameters that allow you to control the behaviour of the materials globally, using a material parameter collection. They are:

- **ReadMinMaxDistanceFromMPC** - If true, the parameters `MinDistance` and `MaxDistance` will be read from the MPC called `MPC_AdvancedActorTransform` instead of the material instance parameters. They are two scalar parameters called `MinDistance` and `MaxDistance`.
- **UseTranslationFromMPC** - If true, the parameter `TranslationVector` will be read from the MPC called `MPC_AdvancedActorTransform` instead of the material instance parameter.
- **UseRotationFromMPC** - If true, the parameter `RotationVector` will be read from the MPC called `MPC_AdvancedActorTransform` instead of the material instance parameter.
- **UseScaleFromMPC** - If true, the parameter `ScaleVector` will be read from the MPC called `MPC_AdvancedActorTransform` instead of the material instance parameter.

This allows you to control the behaviour of the materials globally, without having to change the material instance parameters one by one. This is useful if you have many objects that need to be transformed with the same values and you want to control them all at once.
